# Overview

## Motivation
Agent based instrumentation vs client code based.

### Code Bloat
	
Say we want to instrument a method which calls some third party library or service and tracks the number of failures (as exceptions thrown). To do this we need to track both the total number of method invocations and the number of failed invocations. Most of the time in modern Java libraries, exceptions are unchecked which allows them to propagate up to an appropriate handler without polluting the code base. 

The following is an example of a basic block of code which performs a basic service call prior 
to instrumentation

```java
public Result performSomeTask() {
    return callSomeServiceMethodWhichCanThrowException(createArgs());
}
```

To instrument this programatically we perform the following

```java
// add class fields

final Counter total = Metrics.createCounter("requests_total");
final Counter failed = Metrics.createCounter("requests_failed");

public Result performSomeTask() {
    total.inc();

    Result result = null;
    try {
        //perform actual original call
        result = callSomeServiceMethodWhichCanThrowException(createArgs());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        failed.inc();
        throw e;
    }

    return result;
}
```

Now lets add a timer to this also so we can see how long the method call takes.

```java
// add class fields

final Counter total = Metrics.createCounter("requests_total");
final Counter failed = Metrics.createCounter("requests_failed");
final Timer timer = Metrics.createTimer("requests_timer");

public Result performSomeTask() {
    long startTime = System.nanoTime();
    total.inc();

    Result result = null;
    try {
        result = callSomeServiceMethodWhichCanThrowException(createArgs());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        failed.inc();
        throw e;
    } finally {
        timer.record(System.nanoTime() - startTime);
    }

    return result;
}
```
		
WOW! That turned ugly fast! We started with 3 LOC (lines of code) representing the business logic and ended up with 17 LOC, 14 of which were due to our metrics. This has the potential to destroy the clarity of a code base.

With agent based instrumentation we can inject bytecode which results in the exact same method bytecode as would be produced by writing and compiling the final metric example, but without touching the source.

### Dependency Injection 
Dependency injection frameworks like Spring and Guice have support and libraries to enable annotation driven instrumentation of classes. However, to reply on DI frameworks to instrument class it means that the classes you want to instrument must be injected via the framework. This results in some severe restrictions and can be quite painful when you think a method is being instrumented but in fact it is not.


### Third Party Code
Sometimes we don't have access to the source code for a piece of code we would like to instrument. With agent based instrumentation this isn't an issue and we can instrument it as if it were ours.

Other times, even if the code is available we may still want to instrument certain parts of it without forking it, adding metric code and maintaining it. Agent based metrics gets us out of this bind also.

Don't forget, the JDK is just another library which can be instrumented!

### Human Error
Monotonous code is more susceptible to bugs. Instrumentation of the above metrics can be seen as exceptionally tedious. Therefore, as the number of instrumented methods increase, the likelihood of a bug increases rapidly. Using agent based instrumentation removes this possibility. 

Incorrectly naming a metric can also be considered a bug. Fixing this with manual instrumentation requires a code change and redeploy. This is also the case if using annotation based agent instrumentation. However, if using the configuration driven agent instrumentation then this is a simple matter of updating the configuration and restarting the application.


## Features

## Labels

Labels are composed of name value pairs `({name}:{value})`. You can have up to a maximum of five labels per metric. 

See the Prometheus metric library guidelines on metric and label naming [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/).

### Dynamic Label Values

Label values can be dynamic and set based on variables available on the method stack. Metric names cannot be dynamic. The way we specify dynamic label values is using the `${index}` syntax followed by the method argument index. The special value `"$this"` can be used for referencing `"this.toString()"` in non static methods (i.e. where `"this."` is valid).
 
Note that we restrict the stack usage to the method arguments only. That is, we don't allow use of variables created within the method as that is a very fragile thing to do. 

The String representation as given by `String.valueOf()` of the parameter is used as the label value. That means for primitive types we perform boxing first and null objects will result in the String `"null"`. Argument indexes start at index 0. 

```java
@Counted (name = "service_total", labels = { "client:$0" })
public void callService(String client) 
```

Each time this method is invoked it will use the value of the "client" parameter as the metric label value. 

We also support accessing nested property values. For example, `($1.httpMethod)` where `$1` is the first method parameter and is e.g. of type HttpRequest. This means you are essentially doing `HttpRequest.getHttpMethod().toString();`. This nested can be arbitrarily deep.


## Instrumentation Metadata 

You can use either annotations or configuration to instrument your code. Obviously the later doesn't require you to actually change your code whereas the former does. 

### Annotations

```java
@Counted (name = "", labels = { }, doc = "")
@Gauged (name = "", mode=inc | dec, labels = { }, doc = "")
@Timed (name = "", labels = { }, doc = "")
@ExceptionCounted (name = "", labels = { }, doc = "")
```

Annotations are provided for all metric types and can be added to methods including
constructors. 

```java
@Counted(name = "taskx_total", doc = "total invocations of task x")
@Timed (name = "taskx_time", doc = "duration of task x")
public Result performSomeTask() {
    //...
}
```

### Configuration

	metrics:
	  {class name}.{method name}{method signature}:
	    - type: Counted
		  name: {name}
		  doc: {metric documentation}
		  labels: ['{name:value}', '{name:value}']
	    - type: Gauged
		  name: {name}
		  mode: {mode}
		  doc: {metric documentation}
		  labels: ['{name:value}']
	    - type: ExceptionCounted
		  name: {name}
		  doc: {metric documentation}
		  labels: ['{name:value}']
	    - type: Timed
		  name: {name}
		  doc: {metric documentation}
		  labels: ['{name:value}']

Each metric is defined on a per method basis. A method is uniquely identified by the 
combination of `{class name}.{method name}{method signature}`. As an example, if we 
wanted to instrument the following method via configuration instead of annotations

```java
package com.fleury.test;
....

public class TestClass {
    ....
    
    @Counted(name = "taskx_total", doc = "total invocations of task x")
    public Result performSomeTask() {
        ...
    }
}
```

We write the configuration as follows

	metrics:
	  com.fleury.test.TestClass.performSomeTask()V:
	    - type: Counted
		  name: taskx_total
		  doc: total invocations of task x


Note the method signature is based on the method parameter types and return type. The
parameter types are between the brackets `()` with the return type after. In this case
we have no parameters and the return type is void which results in `()V`. [Here](http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/java/tutorial/native1.1/implementing/method.html) is a good overview of Java method signature mappings.

### What we actually Transform
As we allow the use of annotations to register metrics to track, we must scan all classes as they are loaded and check for the annotations. However, we do not want to 
have to rewrite all of these classes if we have not changed anything. There are many reasons you want to modify as little as possible with an agent but the general motto is, only touch what you have to. Hence, we only rewrite classes which have been changed due to the addition of metrics and all other classes, even though scanned, are returned untouched to the classloader.

## Supported Metrics Systems

### Prometheus
Prometheus is the primary supported metric system. The design of the metric meta data was driven by its design (name, labels, doc). It also has the most powerful reporting system and does not require the development / integration of a multitude of reporting sinks like Codeahale does (e.g. Graphite, Librato, etc). 

Also, given the fact that we use the multidimensional labels concept from Prometheus, if we use a system which doesn't support this notion then it is not nearly as powerful. 


### Codahale 

Sometimes however, we don't want to go to all the hassle of setting up and entire metrics monitoring system if we don't have one already in place and are only interested in the metrics on a single JVM. 
This is where we would recommend Codahale as it provides summary statistics (percentiles, rates etc) out of the box for certain metric types. These are automatically exposed via JVM and can be viewed and graphed with the likes of the VisualVM JMX plugin. 

Some differences in metric types exist between Prometheus and Codahale. In particular, with Prometheus you don't decrement counters, instead you use gauges for values that increase and decrease. Supporting this approach with Codahale gauges with an agent is tricky as we need to maintain a class variable. Hence, we simply use counters to back gauges with Codahale. 

Profiling agents can sometimes be far to heavy to attach to a JVM for a prolonged period of time and impact performance when we only want to monitor certain methods / hotspots. Also, most of the time these tools do not provide summary metrics exception counts which can be recorded with this library.

### Configuration

The metric systems configuration is passed as simple key-value pairs `(Map<String,String>)` to the constructor of each MetricSystem via their provider. These key-values are defined in the "system" section of the agent configuration.

    metrics:
        .....

    system:
        key1: value1

j.u.l is used for logging and can be configured by passing the agent argument `log-config:<properties path>` to the agent with the path to the logger properties file. 


## Performance
We use the Java ASM bytecode manipulation library. This is the lowest level and fastest of all the bytecode libraries which is used by the likes of cglib. It allows us to inject bytecode in a precise way which means we can craft the exact same bytecode as if it was hand written. 

Application startup time is affected slightly (milliseconds). As the bytecode is the exact same as if you were to manually instrument the code by hand, the Application has no real performance overhead than if you wrote it by hand. However, there is currently one performance penalty which must be paid which is not always the case with hand crafted. To make the metric system pluggable, we chose to abstract the metric work behind a generic SPI interface. The bytecode which we inject uses the SPI which can in turn be swapped out without any change to our bytecode. This makes it very flexible but it comes at the cost of not being able to keep field level static variable references for our metrics. Instead we perform a lookup from a ConcurrentHashMap to get the metric by name in the SPIs. Note that JIT takes care of the additional method dispatches up to the Map by performing inlining. To change to injecting field variables into the classes instead of performing this lookup via the SPI would require chaning to either the ASM Tree API or removing ability to use annotations. The reason is that we visit the method annotations after the class fields. We will look at both options going forward.

The reason we chose ConcurrentHashMap and not HashMap is that it even though we don't require its concurrency features (as registration (put) is single threaded), it has better performance characteristics for get() across the various generations of JDKs this library supports (JDK 6+). It uses slightly more memory than basic HashMap but this is a negligible concern. On average the lookup adds an additional 10 nanoseconds overhead on metric operations. To put this into context; if you are instrumenting a request dispatcher and the average request duration is 1 millisecond, then the effect of the lookup is an additional overhead of 0.000001%. If however this is a performance sensitive method which has a typical invocation duration in the nanoseconds then hand crafted metrics should be considered. Similarly if there are many hash collisions this lookup will become slower.

On basic counters, this is noticeable but on other metric types it becomes less observable. We did notice however that when using labels with Prometheus counters there is a significant overhead introduced which makes the lookup even less noticeable. Here are some basic figures of both Prometheus and Codahale counters with and without lookups performed. 

We will produce JMH benchmarks to prove the above notes, however since we are only adding an additional map based lookup the benchmarks do not add much to the respective metric system benchmarks apart from also measuring this lookup.  

It should be noted that as with hand crafted metrics, the additional bytecode and hence method size required to handle capturing all metrics could potentially lead to methods which might otherwise have been inlined or compiled by the JIT being skipped instead. This should be considered regardless off the instrumentation choice and if unsure, the appropriate JVM output should be checked (-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintInlining -XX:+PrintCompilation).
